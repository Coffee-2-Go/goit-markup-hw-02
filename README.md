## Acceptance criteria

### Project

`"A1"` In the root of the project there is an `images` folder with images.

`"A2"` At the root of the project there is a `css` folder with a style file.

`"A3"` All styles are written in one `styles.css` file, which is located in the css folder.

`"A9"` The code is written in accordance with the [**instructions**](https://codeguide.co/).

### Markup

`"B1"` The markup of the `Our Portfolio` section is typed in the file `index.html`. HTML markup of all layout elements is done.

`"B2"` Tags are used according to their semantic content.

`"B3"` HTML passes the [validator](http://validator.w3.org/nu/) without errors.

`"B4"` Class names are descriptive and understandable to another developer.

`"B5"` Class names do not contain capital letters, spaces, transliteration and tag names. Names contain only English letters and words. If the class name consists of several words, they are separated by a hyphen.

`"B6"` `<img>` tags have size attributes, at least `width`.

`"B7"` Images exported from layout in `jpg` format.

`"B8"` Groups of elements of the same type are collected in `<ul>` lists.

`"B9"` All necessary fonts according to the layout and their variations (weight and drawing) are connected from the Google Fonts service with one link. The required weight for `Raleway` is 700, and for `Roboto` - 400, 500, 700.

### Design

`"C1"` Class selectors are used for design.

`"C2"` `!important` is missing in the styles.

`"C3"` Interactive elements (buttons and links), when hovered with the mouse or focus from the keyboard, have the active state indicated in the [Style guide](https://www.figma.com/file/wuEpGhwCepGCOUw7mZFRac/Web-Studio-(Version-5.0)?type=design&node-id=296641-536&mode=design&t=HqslgV0OjDOknzIj-0) (color change).

`"C4"` The text of the contacts in the header changes color on hover and focus.

`"C5"` The `font-family` property with the dominant font on the `Roboto` layout is set for the `<body>` element.

`"C6"` Alternative font options and family type (without indentations) are indicated at the end of the `font-family` list in the `<body>` element.

`"C7"` The `Roboto` font family is explicitly specified only for the `<body>` element, other elements follow it.

`"C8"` For the `<body>` element, the property `color` is set with the dominant color of the text on the layout. The rest of the text follows or overlaps this meaning.

`"C9"` The font size (`font-size` property) of all text elements exactly corresponds to the values ​​from the layout.

`"C10"` The line height (`line-height` property) of all text elements exactly corresponds to the values ​​from the layout and is set as a multiplier, not in px.

`"C11"` The color (`color` and `background-color` properties) of all elements exactly matches the values ​​from the layout.

`"C12"` The font weight (`font-weight` property) of all text elements exactly corresponds to the values ​​from the layout. The font weight is explicitly specified only if the value in the layout is different from the default for this element in the browser.

`"C13"` Buttons are assigned the property `cursor` with the value `pointer`.

`"C14"` Styles do not repeat the values ​​of the properties set by the browser by default. For example, links do not need to specify `cursor: pointer`, and paragraphs `font-style: normal` or `font-weight: 400`.
